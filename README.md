# Prototype 1: Super Roll-a-ball
 Inspired by Super Monkey Ball, provided with the framework of Roll-a-ball, and constructed with the expertise of some random guy, here is Super Roll-a-Ball.
 Considering the scale of this project, I decided to use the MDA framework as a guide when creating this game.
 There is not a lot of assets to cover, nor do I have the artistic expertise to make the game close to aesthetically pleasing, so I prioritized simplicity as an alternative to aesthetics. If there is one definite attribute that I have learned so far with respect to game frameworks, it is that games are player-oriented; so I tried my best within this time-frame to make it look minimalist and feel comfortable to look at and play, even if there is not much content. Needless to say, this was a wonderful failure.
